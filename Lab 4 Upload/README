Vivado doesn't work for me in class for some reason so I can only do the labs at home

I finished the code and was able to succesfully upload it to the board, however, I don't have the calculator

I can bring the board back with me to class and then get another video of the calculator working during class Tuesday 11/9

This is all I can upload for now
